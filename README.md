This report aims to analyze carbon emissions to examine the carbon footprint across various industries. We aim to identify sectors with the highest levels of emissions by analyzing them across countries and years, as well as to uncover trends.  

Carbon emissions play a crucial role in the environment, accounting for over 75% of global emissions and posing a significant environmental challenge. These emissions contribute to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, leading to climate change, planetary warming, and involvement in various environmental disasters.  

Through this analysis, we hope to gain an understanding of the environmental impact of different industries and contribute to making informed decisions in sustainable development.  

## Data Source: Where Our Data Comes From  
Our dataset is compiled from publicly available data from nature.com and encompasses the product carbon footprints (PCF) for various companies. PCFs represent the greenhouse gas emissions associated with specific products, quantified in CO2 (carbon dioxide equivalent).  

## Data Structure  
The dataset consists of 4 tables containing information regarding carbon emissions generated during the production of goods.

## 2. Project brief
 Project brief
You are required to analyze the data to answer the given questions and compile a comprehensive report in the repository on Github, which includes the following:

[‚ùómandatory] Logical division using headers of different levels.
[‚ùómandatory] Listings of SQL queries.
[‚ùómandatory] Tables with the results of SQL queries.
[‚ùómandatory] Text explanations for the executed queries.
[‚ùómandatory] Conclusions and insights based on the obtained database responses.
(where you can identify potentially useful insights, interesting facts, or patterns; for example, upon closer examination, it can be observed that the "Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences" industry is one of the leaders in carbon emissions - "Now we know what our health comes at.").
Additional requirements
[‚ùómandatory] The project report should begin with a description of the task and an overview of the tables (SQL query to each table for selecting all columns for the first 5-10 rows).
[‚ùómandatory] All fractional values should be rounded to 2 decimal places.
Optional points
[‚≠êÔ∏èoptional] Illustrations such as photographs (e.g., cover photo at the beginning of the report), graphs (e.g., graphs generated using MS Excel or Google Sheets based on data), diagrams (database schema), and others.
[‚≠êÔ∏èoptional] Any additional research and conclusions are welcome. For example:
Research of carbon emissions over continents.
Checking correlations, such as the correlation between product weight and carbon emissions levels.
Exploring the environmental friendliness of industrial sectors.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools to use
To execute this project, you are encouraged to utilize any tools they find useful without limitations.

However, we have prepared a set of tools that will greatly assist them in completing the project:

Online SQL Console: Link to SQL Console
(‚ö†Ô∏è Note that at the bottom of the SQL console, there is a panel for conveniently generating Markdown code, which will aid you in report formatting for Github).

Online Markdown Editor: Link to Markdown Editor
(This editor is ideal for writing and formatting Markdown code for the report. It features a toolbar for quick text formatting in Markdown, even if the student is not proficient in writing Markdown code independently.
‚ö†Ô∏è Additionally, it is recommended to write the report in this editor, as it saves the code every second, preventing situations where the student accidentally loses their work without saving).

You can also connect to the database and execute queries using any MySQL-compatible client, including DBeaver.

 

Connection details for a database client 
(only if you decided not to use online console, that is highly discouraged):
